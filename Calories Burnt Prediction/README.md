This ML project was done in Jupyter Notebook

I used numpy, pandas, mathplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn 

This specific project taught me about data visualization using various subplots, heatmaps, and distplots
while also using the builtin linear progression, xgbooster regression, random forst regression, ridge, and lasso models to test the data provided online

I analyzed the bias and variance of each model to determine the best fit out of the box without building my own or tweaking the inputs
